congratulations on making it here alive!

so I'll list the important files:

Drive2.java -> the TeleOp program

NewBestAuto -> the last auto we worked on

check those out and go over them to know what's up and...

checek out MecanumDrive.java to know how the tuning is done


that's pretty much it, ask me anything you want about this (no matter the time I wil always make sure to respond as soon as i possibly can)

alright make sure to study :3
